# Sxgnal


Sxgnal is a social media app made I made to show off some skills!




### Tech


* [Laravel] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Vue] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Vuex] - Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications.
* [Falcon Bootstrap] - Admin Dashboard & WebApp Template (to save time with CSS)
